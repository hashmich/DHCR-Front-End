    <h3 id="question1">Question 1 - Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</h3>
    <h4>Answer 1 - Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem 
        Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" </h4>
